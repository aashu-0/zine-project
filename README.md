1) color-detect.py: Real-time color (Red, Green, Blue) detection using PC camera.

2) color.py: determine the lower/upper color ranges using trackbars for mask.

3) detection.py: Real-time distance measurement of object from PC camera. For detection we need to first identify the lower and upper color ranges of object(using color.py) and then substitute it into detection.py.
